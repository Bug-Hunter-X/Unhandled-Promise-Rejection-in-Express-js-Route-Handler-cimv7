# Unhandled Promise Rejection in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling within route handlers.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Problem

The original code attempts to fetch user data from a database. However, it lacks proper error handling for scenarios where the database operation fails or the user is not found.  This can result in unhandled promise rejections, crashes, or unexpected responses to clients.

## Solution

The solution introduces comprehensive error handling.  It checks for errors during database operations and responds appropriately (e.g., with HTTP 500 for internal server errors and HTTP 404 for not found).  This ensures robustness and prevents unexpected application behavior.
